For my culminative final school project, Flatiron's React-Redux Portfolio Project, I chose to finally bring to life an application that for decades many have wished existed--one that combines some of my greatest interests in life: pop culture, the 90's, vintage fashion, and digital nostalgia. 

Yes, I recreated [Cher's iconic wardrobe program](https://www.github.com/dalmaboros/chers_wardrobe) from the [opening scene](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNDubWJU0aU) of Clueless. You're welcome.

The application is minimal in functionality, but later in this post I will detail my plans for future iterations. As it exists right now, all you can do is what we were shown on screen by a young Alicia Silverstone 26 years ago--scroll through a collection of preppy 90's attire and programatically determine matching outfit combinations. (Spoiler alert: there is only one.)

As far as technical logistics, it's built with React and Redux. There are a handful of stateful and stateless components, implementation of RESTful routing with `react-router`, and handling of asynchronous actions using `redux-thunk` middleware. Styling is achieved with flexbox and custom CSS. 

My original intention for this application was to be a platform for showcasing my inventory of the 200+ pieces of vintage clothing I still own from the days when I sold vintage clothes as a main (and later, side) hustle. That being said, I am delighted to have recreated the original program as it was portrayed on screen, and to have a solid foundation of an app to expand upon. 

Beyond some much-needed styling tweaks, code refactoring, responsive design and accessibility features, my future plans for the app include teaching a neural network my sense of style to be an algorithm for determining mismatching and matching outfits, as well as implementing image uploading and user authentication capabilities. I envision an application that allows anyone to upload their personal wardrobes and, by proxy of AI, have me dress them.
