There is learning, and then there's effective learning. Everyone can learn, but not everyone knows how to learn effectively. 

Before I enrolled in [Flatiron School's](https://flatironschool.com/) [Online Web Development Program](https://flatironschool.com/programs/online-web-developer-career-course/), I took a free MOOC on [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/) called "[Learning How to Learn](https://www.coursera.org/learn/learning-how-to-learn)," which I highly recommend to anyone considering learning anything new in the future (read: everybody). I also recommend the book the class is based on, "[A Mind for Numbers](https://www.amazon.com/Mind-Numbers-Science-Flunked-Algebra-ebook/dp/B00G3L19ZU)," written by the MOOC instructor, [Dr. Barbara Oakley](http://barbaraoakley.com/). Here I will outline the key takeaways from the class, and the principles I use everyday in my studies here on [Learn.co](https://learn.co/). 

**Why should you care about learning effectively?**
* Learning is an inherent and inevitable part of life, and is therefore a skill anyone and everyone can benefit from.
* Natural ineptitude is a myth. Anyone can learn anything, with the right approach.

**1. Focused and Diffuse Modes of Thinking**
* The Focused Mode is a concentrated, focused form of thinking. It lets you 'consume' new topics.
* The Diffuse Mode is a relaxed, unfocused form of thinking. It helps your brain 'digest' these topics to make new connections with pre-existing neural pathways.
* Both modes are critical for effective learning.
* When you start to feel frustrated or 'saturated,' it's time to enter the Diffuse Mode. Trying to keep learning at this point will be a waste of your time, it just won't work.
* Examples of activities that trigger the Diffuse Mode of thinking:
 * Sleep, exercise, going for a walk, dancing, showering, anything that isn't a focused activity that lets your mind wander

**2. Create Understanding**
* Ask yourself: Do you really understand the material? Or are you just blindly memorizing?
* If you can't explain a topic to someone else, you don't understand it.
* If you don't understand it, you haven't learned it.
* Don't skip over difficult topics. Stop and Google a topic that is vague or confusing.
* Create metaphors. They link abstract ideas to concrete topics in your brain, which helps create understanding.

**3. Make Mistakes**
* Embrace mistakes. No, strive for mistakes!
* By making mistakes, you will learn exactly what *not* to do next time!
* Mistakes reveal gaps in your knowledge, areas you need to study more.

**4. Learn Actively, Not Passively**
* Reading books, listening to lectures, and note-taking are passive learning techniques. They don't require much effort. 
* Recalling material and self-testing are active learning techniques, as they actually require brain power.
* Active learning techniques trigger and strengthen neuronal connections in your brain.
* Active learning also reveals gaps in knowledge, highlighting topics you need to study more.

**5. Spaced Repetition**
* It is better to study a little bit at a time with greater frequently, than to study a lot at once, like you would when you cram.
* Spaced repetition builds a solid foundation of knowledge over time.
* Forgetting is a natural process of learning. Spaced repetition lets you re-learn topics you naturally forget over time.
* When you cram, you have no way of recovering information you naturally forget.
* [Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/) is a great flash card app with built-in spaced repetition algorithms to help you learn effectively. I use it everyday!

**6. Learn Together, Not Alone**
* Communicating with others in your field reveals new perspectives, better techniques, and gaps in your knowledge.
* Sometimes you don't know what you don't know until someone else shows you.

**7. Sleep**
* A well-rested brain is a well-functioning brain.
* Sleep clears toxic neurochemical by-products from the brain. Without enough sleep your brain can't function optimally.
* During sleep your brain solidifies important neuronal connections and erases unimportant ones. This process works hand-in-hand with spaced repetition. The more frequently you study a topic, the more important it becomes in your brain.
* Sleep is the #1 best way to enter the Diffuse Mode, which is critical for effective learning.

**8. Exercise**
* Exercise is a great form of Diffuse Mode thinking.
* It also increases energy, elevates mood and improves focus.

**9. Nutrition**
* Proper nutrition is critical for optimal brain function.
* Avoid sugar in all its forms, including grains! Sugar impairs learning, memory, cognitive function, and psychological well-being. It exasperates anxiety and depression, and is a risk factor in age-related cognitive decline and dementia.
* Other inflammatory foods that impair brain function include dairy, vegetable oils, processed foods, and grain-fed animal products. 
* Stay hydrated! It keeps you energized, and helps your brain clear itself of toxins.

** TL;DR**
* Understand the topics you are learning.
* Make mistakes!
* Learn actively, not passively.
* Embrace the "Diffuse Mode" of thinking.
* Practice spaced repetition.
* Learn with others.
* Take care of yourself! Get enough sleep, exercise, and good nutrition.
