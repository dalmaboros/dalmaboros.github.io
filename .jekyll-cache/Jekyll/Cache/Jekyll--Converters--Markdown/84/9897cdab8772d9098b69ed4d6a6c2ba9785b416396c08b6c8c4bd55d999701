I"<p>There is learning, and then there’s effective learning. Everyone can learn, but not everyone knows how to learn effectively.</p>

<p>Before I enrolled in <a href="https://flatironschool.com/">Flatiron School’s</a> <a href="https://flatironschool.com/programs/online-web-developer-career-course/">Online Web Development Program</a>, I took a free MOOC on <a href="https://www.coursera.org/">Coursera</a> called “<a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/learning-how-to-learn">Learning How to Learn</a>,” which I highly recommend to anyone considering learning anything new in the future (read: everybody). I also recommend the book the class is based on, “<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Mind-Numbers-Science-Flunked-Algebra-ebook/dp/B00G3L19ZU">A Mind for Numbers</a>,” written by the MOOC instructor, <a href="http://barbaraoakley.com/">Dr. Barbara Oakley</a>. Here I will outline the key takeaways from the class, and the principles I use everyday in my studies here on <a href="https://learn.co/">Learn.co</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Why should you care about learning effectively?</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Learning is an inherent and inevitable part of life, and is therefore a skill anyone and everyone can benefit from.</li>
  <li>Natural ineptitude is a myth. Anyone can learn anything, with the right approach.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>1. Focused and Diffuse Modes of Thinking</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>The Focused Mode is a concentrated, focused form of thinking. It lets you ‘consume’ new topics.</li>
  <li>The Diffuse Mode is a relaxed, unfocused form of thinking. It helps your brain ‘digest’ these topics to make new connections with pre-existing neural pathways.</li>
  <li>Both modes are critical for effective learning.</li>
  <li>When you start to feel frustrated or ‘saturated,’ it’s time to enter the Diffuse Mode. Trying to keep learning at this point will be a waste of your time, it just won’t work.</li>
  <li>Examples of activities that trigger the Diffuse Mode of thinking:</li>
  <li>Sleep, exercise, going for a walk, dancing, showering, anything that isn’t a focused activity that lets your mind wander</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>2. Create Understanding</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Ask yourself: Do you really understand the material? Or are you just blindly memorizing?</li>
  <li>If you can’t explain a topic to someone else, you don’t understand it.</li>
  <li>If you don’t understand it, you haven’t learned it.</li>
  <li>Don’t skip over difficult topics. Stop and Google a topic that is vague or confusing.</li>
  <li>Create metaphors. They link abstract ideas to concrete topics in your brain, which helps create understanding.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>3. Make Mistakes</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Embrace mistakes. No, strive for mistakes!</li>
  <li>By making mistakes, you will learn exactly what <em>not</em> to do next time!</li>
  <li>Mistakes reveal gaps in your knowledge, areas you need to study more.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>4. Learn Actively, Not Passively</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Reading books, listening to lectures, and note-taking are passive learning techniques. They don’t require much effort.</li>
  <li>Recalling material and self-testing are active learning techniques, as they actually require brain power.</li>
  <li>Active learning techniques trigger and strengthen neuronal connections in your brain.</li>
  <li>Active learning also reveals gaps in knowledge, highlighting topics you need to study more.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>5. Spaced Repetition</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>It is better to study a little bit at a time with greater frequently, than to study a lot at once, like you would when you cram.</li>
  <li>Spaced repetition builds a solid foundation of knowledge over time.</li>
  <li>Forgetting is a natural process of learning. Spaced repetition lets you re-learn topics you naturally forget over time.</li>
  <li>When you cram, you have no way of recovering information you naturally forget.</li>
  <li><a href="https://apps.ankiweb.net/">Anki</a> is a great flash card app with built-in spaced repetition algorithms to help you learn effectively. I use it everyday!</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>6. Learn Together, Not Alone</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Communicating with others in your field reveals new perspectives, better techniques, and gaps in your knowledge.</li>
  <li>Sometimes you don’t know what you don’t know until someone else shows you.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>7. Sleep</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>A well-rested brain is a well-functioning brain.</li>
  <li>Sleep clears toxic neurochemical by-products from the brain. Without enough sleep your brain can’t function optimally.</li>
  <li>During sleep your brain solidifies important neuronal connections and erases unimportant ones. This process works hand-in-hand with spaced repetition. The more frequently you study a topic, the more important it becomes in your brain.</li>
  <li>Sleep is the #1 best way to enter the Diffuse Mode, which is critical for effective learning.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>8. Exercise</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Exercise is a great form of Diffuse Mode thinking.</li>
  <li>It also increases energy, elevates mood and improves focus.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>9. Nutrition</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Proper nutrition is critical for optimal brain function.</li>
  <li>Avoid sugar in all its forms, including grains! Sugar impairs learning, memory, cognitive function, and psychological well-being. It exasperates anxiety and depression, and is a risk factor in age-related cognitive decline and dementia.</li>
  <li>Other inflammatory foods that impair brain function include dairy, vegetable oils, processed foods, and grain-fed animal products.</li>
  <li>Stay hydrated! It keeps you energized, and helps your brain clear itself of toxins.</li>
</ul>

<p>** TL;DR**</p>
<ul>
  <li>Understand the topics you are learning.</li>
  <li>Make mistakes!</li>
  <li>Learn actively, not passively.</li>
  <li>Embrace the “Diffuse Mode” of thinking.</li>
  <li>Practice spaced repetition.</li>
  <li>Learn with others.</li>
  <li>Take care of yourself! Get enough sleep, exercise, and good nutrition.</li>
</ul>
