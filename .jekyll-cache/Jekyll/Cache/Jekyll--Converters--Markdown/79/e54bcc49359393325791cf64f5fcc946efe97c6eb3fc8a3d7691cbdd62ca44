I"£<p>For my final school project, the React-Redux Portfolio Project, I chose to synthesize an amalgam of some of my greatest interests in life: pop culture, the 90â€™s, vintage fashion, and digital nostalgia.</p>

<p>Yes, I created <a href="https://www.github.com/dalmaboros/chers_wardrobe">Cherâ€™s iconic wardrobe program</a> from the opening scene of Clueless. Youâ€™re welcome.</p>

<p>The app is minimal in functionality, but later in this post I will detail my plans for future iterations. As it exists right now, all you can do is what we were shown on screen by a young Alicia Silverstone 26 years agoâ€“scroll through a collection of preppy 90â€™s attire and programatically determine matching outfit combinations. (Spoiler alert: there is only one.)</p>

<p>As far as technical logistics, itâ€™s built with React and Redux. There are a handful of stateful and stateless components, implementation of RESTful routing with <code class="highlighter-rouge">react-router</code>, and handling of asynchronous actions using <code class="highlighter-rouge">redux-thunk</code> middleware. Styling is achieved with flexbox and custom CSS.</p>

<p>My original intention for this app was to be a platform for showcasing my inventory of 200+ pieces of vintage clothing. Iâ€™m happy to have brought the iconic fictional program to life, and to have a foundation to expand upon.</p>
