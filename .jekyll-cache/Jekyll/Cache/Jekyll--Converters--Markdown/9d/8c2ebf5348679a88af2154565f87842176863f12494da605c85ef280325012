<p>I created a Sinatra-based web application for my end-of-unit Sinatra Portfolio Project. It is a content management system (CMS) for Sickbay, an ongoing series of live alternative music events in Lafayette, Louisiana. The app is designed to allow the organizer of Sickbay to easily create, read, update, and delete shows and news items, as well as artists and venues.</p>
