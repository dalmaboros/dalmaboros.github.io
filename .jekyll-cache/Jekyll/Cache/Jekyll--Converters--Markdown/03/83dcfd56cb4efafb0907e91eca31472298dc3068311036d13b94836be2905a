I"•<p>The process of creating my Rails Portfolio project was drawn out and full of mistakes. It started with an idea. I wanted to have a bowl in real life, fill it with scraps of paper, each with an activity written on it. In my downtime I could pull a random scrap from the bowl, and do the activity written on it, filling my free time with productive things. Bowls is a digitized version of that idea.</p>
