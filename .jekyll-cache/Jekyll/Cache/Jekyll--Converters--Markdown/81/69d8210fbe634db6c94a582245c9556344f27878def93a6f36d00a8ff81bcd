I"Ï<p>I built a Ruby command line interface (CLI) gem application as my first portfolio project in the <a href="https://flatironschool.com/programs/online-web-developer-career-course/">Online Web Development Program</a> at <a href="https://flatironschool.com/">Flatiron School</a>. I created a program that displays the weekly schedule of bills to be debated on the United States House of Representatives floor. It pulls data from the <a href="http://docs.house.gov/floor/">House Floor</a> web page, as well as from individual bill pages on <a href="https://www.congress.gov/">Congress.gov</a>. Interestingly, the House Floor schedule does not provide links to the individual bill pages. Fortunately, my program does!</p>
